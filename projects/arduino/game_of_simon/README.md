This project allows you to build a classic game, the Game of Simon. This project also allows you to start learning how to program the Arduino microcontroller. Upon completion of this project you should have some basic understanding of how to update the Arduino's programming and wire up a simple project. The Arduino kit used in this project allows you to easily transition to other projects on this page as several of them utilize the this kit.

## Power Point Presentation
If you want futher details on every step or a deeper understanding of what is being done and how things work, you can view this power point that is used for the 2 hour Cary Area Library course.
